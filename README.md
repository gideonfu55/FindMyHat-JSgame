# javascriptassessment

●	What did you like about this project?

This project was challenging, but at the same time, it required the use of all the things that we have learnt during the lessons. It was fun to see the character move on the field, and I actually became a game 'developer' in the process XD.

●	What did you struggle with in this project?

I was stuck at the nested loop for placing holes on the field quite a bit, as I explored many other options to enter a fix number of holes at random locations on the map. Understanding how the different components of the project came together was also difficult, as you might be defining a function that could work on it's own (e.g. movement), but it might not work within the whole module when it runs on the terminal.

●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?

I think I needed more practice with combining all different JS elements, and the logical process is still difficult to grasp at times. Having more projects as examples that can be referenced (even if indirectly) could make the learning flow better.
